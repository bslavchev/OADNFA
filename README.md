- Write a critical review report of thesis project
- Re-develop ML model, taking findings of critical review into account
- Develop dispatcher script that allows the ML model to execute the solvers
- Containerize ML model + dispatcher script + solvers

## Wishlist
These are roadmap items that have not found a place on the roadmap yet.
